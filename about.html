    <h1>My Standard is the Standard!</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Michelle, Lead Balloon artist of Infinite Party Designs. We have been in the Event
        planning / Party Decor industry for about 2.5 years now! Infinite Party Designs has grown a lot, and we are
        excited about it! We been focused on getting our name out there while making great content to keep our target
        audience entertained! If you had to pick three qualities that are most important to develop, which three would
        you say matter most?
        Three areas would be Producing Quality balloon designs! Meaning using the good quality materials like
        Qualatex, sempertex balloons. We cant charge hundreds of dollars to give our clients dollar tree balloons. When
        we use quality materials the balloon install looks so incredible if I may say so myself. Time Management- make a
        schedule and plan out your appointments. When you are a procrastinator with your time your work can be poor
        because youre rushing. That equals a poor and rushed install. Knowing your worth and charging YOUR price! This
        is so important in the event decoration/ planning industry. Dont low ball yourself just to get the client. That
        never ends well when you change the price later. Research and get to know who your target customer will be. If
        they love and really want the balloon decorations they will pay the cost! Period.</p>
